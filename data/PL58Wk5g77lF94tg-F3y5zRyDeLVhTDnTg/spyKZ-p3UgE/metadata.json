  "description": "Automation has come a long way in assisting with regression testing efforts. Teams worldwide are successfully running hundreds of functional regression tests at every check-in. While this provides a great source of confidence, critical regression bugs are still missed using this approach. That’s because these tests can only assert on what their human programmer asks them to. Additional errors with functionality, UX, and usability often go uncaught using today’s most common test automation techniques.\n\nFor this reason, the top companies in all sectors of the industry are turning to visual validation. Visual validation is a relatively new concept that can be used to enhance existing automated tests and provide an easy way to perform those difficult checks for things like UX, localization, usability, responsive design, and cross-device testing.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how visual validation works, see a live integration into an existing test code base, and discuss the pros and cons of using various visual validation techniques.",
