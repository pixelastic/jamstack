  },
  {
    "content": "areas that were sort of unexplored right so if we look at the technical direction",

  },
  {
    "content": "of the project uh and we look at things like es modules",
    "start": 184
  },

    "content": "es modules are an easy like first win um we'll talk a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "bit more about these in depth as we go through the talk so",

  },
  {
    "content": "slightly different than the way that other frameworks do it",

  },
  {
    "content": "and uh one of the things that i really wanted was",

  },
  {
    "content": "first class mdx support so when we talk about esm or es modules",
    "start": 228
  },
  {
    "content": "um i believe that now is the time to do esm first if you build a new framework",

  {
    "content": "today it should be esm first or esm exclusive and the reason",
    "start": 241
  },
  {
    "content": "for this is that all the evergreen or modern browsers already support it",
    "start": 246
  },
  {
    "content": "so we can write code that works with static import syntax and dynamic imports",

    "content": "in the browser and it will just run and work like without any extra ceremony",

  {
    "content": "which is pretty amazing because the way that we're used to doing it is kind of",

  {
    "content": "like throwing them through webpack and then having webpack translate that to",

  },
  {
    "content": "its own like require dot resolve kind of stuff um",
    "start": 267

    "content": "bundling it up and shipping it to the browser browsers giant",

  },
  {
    "content": "just dive into the source code and read it like we would normally write it",
    "start": 289

  {
    "content": "the other thing about esm is that node version 14 unflagged esm support",
    "start": 292

  {
    "content": "so what that means is that at the end of october 2020",

  },
  {
    "content": "in addition any new and experimental frameworks",

  },
  {
    "content": "are going esm first right um if you think of you know if you think of",
    "start": 321
  },
  {
    "content": "uh more experimental projects like jstime everybody is starting with the s",

  },
  {
    "content": "modules so es modules are definitely the future",
    "start": 329
  },
  {
    "content": "now if we go with es modules we need less webpack",
    "start": 333
  },
  {
    "content": "so we just kind of get rid of webpack now webpack does a bunch of stuff for us",
    "start": 336

    "content": "there's a couple of things that we probably want to take back um but we",

    "content": "don't need all of webpack right we don't need all of webpack to be",

  },
  {
    "content": "so we remove the webpack complexity we go es modules first",
