  {
    "content": "able to to do that so that would be where I would start does that seem like",

    "content": "get back let's look at the documentation for unsplash yeah so I think what would",

    "content": "search term we will be able to get the first page we can limit to 10 that's",

  {
    "content": "something we need to stress about yet so let's let's get our actual request going",

    "content": "can use which is really helpful so I'm gonna go into the functions directory",

  {
    "content": "and we're gonna make this into its own node app and this is important so what",
    "start": 3724
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm what I'm doing right now is because the functions are deployed separately",
    "start": 3731
  },
  {
    "content": "they have to have all of their dependencies contained in that functions",
    "start": 3736

  },
  {
    "content": "if we're accessing local data all of that needs to be in the functions folder",
    "start": 3745
  },
  {
    "content": "or we have to have our build step move all that stuff into the functions folder",
    "start": 3750
  },
  {
    "content": "and the the reason for that is that what we do is we take the functions folder",
    "start": 3755
  },
  {
    "content": "and just straight up send it to Amazon and so if it reads if it tries to read",
    "start": 3760
  },
  {
    "content": "something outside of functions it won't be there after it gets deployed so",
    "start": 3765
  },
  {
    "content": "because of that anything that we're gonna use inside is going to be",
    "start": 3769
  },
  {
    "content": "installed in the functions folder itself so I'm an install node fetch and now I",
