  "description": "Talk given by Nicolas Goutay, at the remote JAMstack Meetup #14 on July 27th, 2020.\nhttps://twitter.com/Phacks\nhttps://www.meetup.com/JAMStack_berlin/events/270907371/\n\nDuring the last two years, the median webpage size across the web increased by over 30%, from 1.5Mb to 2Mb—resulting in worse performance for end-users.\r\n\r\nWhile the Jamstack philosophy is rooted in frugality, many recent Jamstack approaches rely on heavy JavaScript frameworks that give us top-notch Developer Experience at the expense of heavier web pages. What is the true cost of those frameworks? And how can we alleviate it?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will first describe the end-user impact of using JavaScript frameworks, then discuss options to reduce that impact for existing Jamstack websites, to finally present and review the “lightweight Jamstack” we used to redesign https://orbit.love: Eleventy, Alpine and Tailwind.\n\nContentful Developer portal - www.contentful.com/developers/\nContentful Community Slack - www.contentful.com/slack/",
