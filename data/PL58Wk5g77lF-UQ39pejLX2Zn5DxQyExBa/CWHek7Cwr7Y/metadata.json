  "description": "We will build and deploy a static site that is backed by content on Postgres. We will also setup serverless automation so that whenever content changes on Postgres, we will re-render the site and deploy again with a maximum of one deploy every 5mins.\n\nIn 15 minutes, you will be witness to the raw awesomeness of having the flexibility of a dynamic website backed by a database with performance and scalability of a static website.\n\nRecorded at JAMstack Conf 2018 in San Francisco.
