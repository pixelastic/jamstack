Using tools that are more approachable not only empowers a broader group of people, it also improves the potential for working teams.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover ways to lower the barrier to entry and overhead of maintenance on projects of all shapes and sizes. We'll talk tools, some of which you might take for granted—like spreadsheets, and ideas, sharing examples in action, that you can use in your projects at work and on weekends.\n\nRecorded at JAMstack Conf 2018 in San Francisco.
