  "description": "In this talk Justin Watts walks his audience through Loblaw Digitals (LD) journey from building 9 digital experiences in 7 years, to preparing for rolling out 150+ in 1 year. Justin dives into what it takes to ‘cross the chasm’ when adopting a new technology, utilizing a concept from Google called the ‘Rainbow of Death’.
