  "description": "The JAMstack approach is powering big projects for major brands at scale. But is it just one more approach or is it the enduring future of how websites are built and delivered? Matt Biilmann, CEO of Netlify, talks about the unique power of the JAMstack approach to speed up the performance of the open webâ€”including what that means in the new landscape of billions of varied devices.
