  {
    "content": "fall so you cannot that's not a static position so basically that position is",

    "content": "movement I will show you in the video instead of me just doing Taekwondo",

  {
    "content": "could all just do this right dynamic don't know make static dynamic and the",

  },
  {
    "content": "same time it depends on when we look at it",
    "start": 409
  },

    "content": "is what I want to explain to you is how the static sites are being built because",
    "start": 483
  },
  {
    "content": "I have a lot of people who save yeah but you can't build that because that's",

  {
    "content": "dynamic and you that can't be in a static site everything can be in a",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "static site so how we do it is if we think about our API is up there okay and",
    "start": 493
  },
  {
    "content": "we have this Taekwondo person just always think of it like wonder person",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "and what they have to do is jump up to the API flying dynamic sidekick take all",

  {
    "content": "that data from the API line back down again and there is your static site with",

  {
    "content": "if we click a button something on the page that we need more data we then send",
    "start": 525
  },
  {
    "content": "that Taekwondo person back up to the API get the data back down again and you",
    "start": 530
  },
  {
    "content": "have your dynamic static side so it's just like this yeah jump up data back",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "down again jump up data back down again okay it's kind of cool I want to do that",
    "start": 537
  },
  {
    "content": "later it'll be fun okay so now do we all understand the difference between",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "in dynamic yes okay great let's move on so so pushing and deploying very easy we",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "just basically we have increased confidence because as soon as we've",
    "start": 554
  },
  {
    "content": "built something we just get push and deploy it's like fantastic and the",

  {
    "content": "so that's kind of really cool and then you've got web hooks on content change",

  {
    "content": "so if your content changes if you change something in the air in your admin for",
    "start": 585
